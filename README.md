## üõ†Ô∏è Working Principle
- Uses **front, left, and right ultrasonic sensors** to measure distances to maze walls.
- Implements a **Right-Hand or Left-Hand Algorithm** for maze solving:
   - If there is space to the right, turn right.
   - If front is clear, move forward.
   - If blocked ahead and right, turn left.
- Continuously updates navigation based on real-time sensor readings.

## üîã Power System
- Powered by a LiPo battery regulated through a buck converter for consistent 5V supply to the Arduino and motor drivers.
- Ensures stable operation across variable load conditions.

## üß† Control Logic
- Ultrasonic sensors connected to Arduino digital pins trigger distance measurement using pulseIn().
- Logic-based decision tree selects motion direction.
- PWM-based speed control adjusts motor speeds during sharp turns.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- Accurate distance measurement (~¬±1 cm error).
- Modular code structure for easy algorithm changes.
- Efficient LiPo battery power with voltage regulation.

## üîß Possible Future Enhancements
- Add PID control for smoother navigation in tight spaces.
- Map the maze dynamically using a grid array or SLAM.
- Replace Arduino Uno with an ESP32 or Raspberry Pi for advanced processing.
